## Our Website is a metadata website for TV shows.
The website displays shows on different pages organised by Genre.
+ It contains data such as the titles of the TV shows, ratings, amount of seasons, year released, director, actor(s) and genre(s).
+ Each genre has its own webpage with each TV show present if their genre matches.
+ Our homepage shows a count of all the TV Shows, Actors and Genres currently on the website.
+ We kept our design consistent throughout each web page by using Bootstrap.
+ User can interact with the website by adding shows and actors through the forms.
+ User login is required to add content.
